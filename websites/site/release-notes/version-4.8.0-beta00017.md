# Lucene.NET 4.8.0-beta00017 Release Notes

---

> This release contains many bug fixes, performance improvements, and other housekeeping/cleanup tasks in preparation of the production 4.8 release.

## Change Log

### Breaking Changes

- Lucene.Net.Util.OfflineSorter: Refactored to base file tracking on FileStream rather than FileInfo, which gives us better control over temp file deletion by specifying the `FileOptions.DeleteOnClose` option. We also use random access so we don't need to reopen streams over files except in the case of ExternalRefSorter.
- Refactored CharArraySet and CharArrayMap (now CharArrayDictionary) ([#762](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/762))
- Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji.Token: Changed these methods into properties: `IsKnown()` to `IsKnown`, `IsUnknown()` to `IsUnknown`, `IsUser()` to `IsUser`.
- SWEEP: Added guard clauses for all TokenAttribute members
- SWEEP: Renamed interface TokenAttribute type file names removing the prefix "I" so the file it was ported from is clear.
- SWEEP: Renamed concrete TokenAttribute type file names to be suffixed with "Impl" so the file it was ported from is clear.
- Lucene.Net.Index.IndexReader: De-nested IReaderClosedListener and renamed to IReaderDisposedListener.
- Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter: Fixed `Dispose()` overloads so there is no method signature conflict between the public `Dispose(waitForMerges)` method and the protected `Dispose(disposing)` method that can be overridden and called from a finalizer. See [#265](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/265).
- Lucene.Net.Search.FieldCacheRangeFilter&lt;T&gt;: Changed accessibility from protected internal to private protected. This class was not intended to be subclassed by users. (see [#677](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/677))
- Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.Fst.ExternalRefSorter: Changed temp path generation to use `FileSupport.CreateTempFile()` with named prefix and extension because it more closely matches Lucene and makes the files more easily identifiable.
- Removed .NET Core 3.1 tests and lucene-cli support for it.  ([#735](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/735))
- Lucene.Net.Util.OfflineSorter: Changed `DefaultTempDir()` to `GetDefaultTempDir()`.
- Disabled Json Source Generator.  ([#727]\(https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/727\))
- Lucene.Net.Analysis.SmartCn.SmartChineseAnalyzer: Changed `GetDefaultStopSet()` to `DefaultStopSet`. Marked `GetDefaultStopSet()` obsolete.
- Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji.JapaneseAnalyzer: Changed `GetDefaultStopSet()` and `GetDefaultStopTags()` to `DefaultStopSet` and `DefaultStopTags`, respectively. Marked the old methods obsolete.
- SWEEP: Fixed ArgumentOutOfRange parameters so the message is passed into the 2nd parameter, not the first (which is for argumentName). Fixes [#665](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/665). Also addressed potential int overflow issues when checking for "index + length must be <= array length".
- Remove NET45, NET451, NET452 Support & update website framework ver ([#650](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/650))
- Lucene.Net.IndexWriter.IEvent: Marked internal (as it was in Java). This interface is only used in non-public contexts by Lucene.
- Remove virtual on methods that are being called from constructors
([#670](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/670) - see PRs linked to this issue)
- Lucene.Net.Util.PriorityQueue&lt;T&gt;: Replaced `(int, bool)` constructor and removed constructor call to virtual `GetSentinelObject()` method ([#820](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/820))
- Lucene.Net.Util: Added ValuePriorityQueue&lt;T&gt; to utilize stack allocations where possible ([#826](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/826))
- Use factory classes for DirectoryTaxonomyWriter and DirectoryTaxonomyReader to get configs ([#847](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/847))


### Bug Fixes

- Lucene.Net.Util.OfflineSorter: Added back original tests using FileInfo and fixed bugs that were preventing the original behavior
- Lucene.Net.Tests.Store.TestRAMDirectory: Fixed teardown to retry file deletion if they are locked by another process.
- fix: Aligned disposable patterns ([#746](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/746))
- BUG: Changed TokenAttribute usage from concrete implementation type to interface type to align with Lucene 4.8.0. We were using the concrete type in several places where it shouldn't have been.
- BUG: Lucene.Net.Util.OfflineSorter: Fixed the `Sort()` and `SortPartition()` methods so they use the tempDirectory parameter that is passed through the constructor, as was the case in Lucene. Added a constructor overload to specify the directory as a string (a .NET convention).
- Update SlowSynonymFilter.cs
- Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji.Util.CSVUtil: Applied SOLR-9413 patch to fix the `QuoteEscape()` method and add tests. Fixes [#660](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/660).
- Lucene.Net.Search.Similarities: Statically imported SimilarityBase where appropriate so the Log2 method doesn't have to be qualified (like in Lucene). Fixes [#694](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/694).
- SWEEP: Fixed a bug where the CharArraySet returned from DefaultStopSet in all analyzers was returning a static writable instance instead of a readonly instance as per the docs.
- BUG: Lucene.Net.Tests.Index.TestIndexWriter: Finished port of RandomFailingFieldEnumerable. Fixes [#695](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/695).
- BUG: Lucene.Net.Benchmark.Support.TagSoup.Parser::SetProperty(): Removed duplicate guard clause
- BUG: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Cjk.CJKBigramFilter: Changed the value of ALL to set all flags (was 0xff instead of 0xffff). Fixes [#657](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/657).
- fix: Order of precedence for translation of `Remove()` method args in FrenchStemmer.cs  ([#654](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/654))
- fix: Fixed Infinite loop in HttpClientBase
- fix: Fixed throw statement in BinaryDictionary
- fix: Fixed use of insecure `Path.GetTempFileName` in ExternalRefSorter ([#651](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/651))
- BUG: Lucene.Net.Search.package.md: Corrected link to TooManyClausesException
- Fix AssertionError in JapaneseTokenizer backtrace LUCENE-10059 ([#777](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/777))
- Lucene.Net.Util.RandomizedContext: Create a separate instance of `Randomizer()` for each thread initialized with the same seed. Fixes [#843](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/843).
- TestIndexWriterOnJRECrash: Removed using block to ensure that our original CheckIndex error bubbles up instead of any issue disposing (or double-disposing) the directory.
- Lucene.Net.Documents.DateTools: Convert `DateTimeKind.Unspecified` dates to UTC, otherwise they can produce ArgumentOutOfRangeException. Fixes [#772](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/772).
- Lucene.Net.Store: Fixed several `Dispose()` methods so they are safe to be called multiple times ([#854](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/854))

### Performance

- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Support.Arrays::CopyOfRange(): Use the Copy() method rather than a for loop for a ~10x improvement in performance.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Support.Arrays::CopyOf(): Use the Copy() method rather than a for loop for a ~10x improvement in performance.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Support.Arrays::Fill(): Replaced for loop implementation with Array.Fill() or Span.Fill<T>() depending on platform.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Support.Arrays: Added Copy() overloads that use the most efficient (known) copy method for the platform and data type based on benchmarks. Replaced all occurrences of Array.Copy() and Buffer.BlockCopy() with Arrays.Copy().
- Lucene.Net.Support.DictionaryExtensions: Reduced dependency on the Put() method and added documentation to indicate that it doesn't work with non-nullable value types. Also documented the PutAll() method and added guard clause.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Sinks.DateRecognizerSinkFilter: Prefer ReadOnlySpan<char> overloads of DateTime.TryParse() and DateTime.TryParseExact(), when available.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analsis.Util.HTMLStripCharFilter: Refactored to remove YyText property (method) which allocates a string every time it is called. Instead, we pass the underlying array to J2N.Numerics.TryParse() and OpenStringBuilder.Append() with the calculated startIndex and length to directly copy the characters without allocating substrings.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Util.OpenStringBuilder: Added overloads of UnsafeWrite() for string an ICharSequence. Optimized Append() methods to call UnsafeWrite with index and count to optimize the operation depending on the type of object passed.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Ga.IrishLowerCaseFilter: Use stack and spans to reduce allocations and improve throughput.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Th.ThaiWordBreaker: Removed unnecessary string allocations and concatenation. Use CharsRef to reuse the same memory. Removed Regex and replaced with UnicodeSet to detect Thai code points.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.In.IndicNormalizer: Refactored ScriptData to change Dictionary<Regex, ScriptData> to List<ScriptData> and eliminated unnecessary hashtable lookup. Use static fields for unknownScript and [ThreadStatic] previousScriptData to optimize character script matching.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.In.IndicNormalizer: Replaced static constructor with inline LoadScripts() method. Moved location of scripts field to ensure decompositions is initialized first.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Ja.GraphvizFormatter: Removed unnecessary surfaceForm string allocation.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Util.SegmentingTokenizerBase: Removed unnecessary string allocations that were added during the port due to missing APIs.
- Lucene.Net.Util.TestUnicodeUtil::TestUTF8toUTF32(): Added additional tests for ICharSequence and char[] overloads, changed the original test to test string.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Miscellaneous.StemmerOverrideFilter: Added overloads to Add for ICharSequence and char[] to reduce allocations. Added guard clauses.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.Util.CharacterUtils: Use spans and stackalloc to reduce heap allocations when lowercasing. Added system property named "maxStackLimit" that defaults to 2048 bytes.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Analysis.CharFilters.HTMLStripCharFilter: Removed allocation during parse of hexadecimal number by using J2N.Numerics.Int32 to specify index and length. Also added a CharArrayFormatter struct to defer the allocation of constructing a string until after an assertion failure.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Codecs.SimpleText.SimpleTextUtil::Write(): Removed unnecessary ToCharArray() allocation
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Document.CompressionTools::CompressString(): Eliminated unnecessary ToCharArray() allocation
- PERFORMANCE: Use 'StringBuilder.Append(char)' instead of 'StringBuilder.Append(string)' when the input is a constant unit string. ([#708]\(https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/708\))
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Util.MergedEnumerator: Changed from using inline string conversions when the generic type is string to J2N.Collections.Generic.Comparer<T>, which is statically initialized with the optimal comparer that matches Java behaviors.
- PERFORMANCE: Lucene.Net.Index.BaseCompositeReader: Removed unnecessary list allocation

    <!-- IMPORTANT: VersionPrefix must always be the same as the Lucene version this is based on.
      Never increment it for an individual build - only increment this when an entire version's changes
      are ported over from Lucene. This is what determines the version of all of the NuGet packages and binaries. 
      For patching a production build, we will add a 4th segment (4.8.0.1) since it would be confusing to increment to 
      4.8.1 if we haven't actually ported over the changes from Lucene 4.8.1. -->
